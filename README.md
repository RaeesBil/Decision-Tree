A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on feature values that maximize the information gain or minimize impurity at each split. The tree is constructed by recursively splitting nodes until leaf nodes represent the final prediction (class label or value). Decision Trees are highly interpretable, as they visually represent the decision-making process, and are effective for non-linear relationships in the data.

This dataset includes medical features such as Age, Sex, BP (Blood Pressure), Cholesterol, and Na_to_K (Sodium to Potassium ratio) with the target variable being Drug (type of medication prescribed). By applying a Decision Tree, we aim to classify which type of drug a patient should be prescribed based on their health profile. The analysis will help understand how various factors like blood pressure and cholesterol influence drug prescriptions, and provide insights into personalized medicine approaches.
